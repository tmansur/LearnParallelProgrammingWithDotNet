## Descrição

This course is about .NET Parallel Programming with C# and covers the core multithreading facilities in the .NET Framework, namely the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ).

This course will teach you about:

- Task Programming: how to create and run tasks, cancel them, wait on them and handle exceptions that occur in tasks.
- Data Sharing and Synchronization, ensuring your access to shared data also happens in a safe and consistent manner.
- Concurrent Collections, such as ConcurrentBag, which operate correctly even when accessed from multiple threads.
- Task Coordination concepts, including the idea of continuations, as well as uses of synchronization primitives to coordinate tasks.
- Parallel Loops which let you easily iterate over a counter or collection while partitioning the data and processing it on separate threads.
- Parallel LINQ, the parallel version of .NET's awesome Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) technology.
- Async/Await and .NET's support for asynchronous programming.
